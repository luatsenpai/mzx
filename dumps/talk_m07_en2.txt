<p 02><d 591B><a 02><n 55>
The office district in
Area G is under heavy
fire from Mavericks.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 5A1B><a 02><n 55>
There are several
Guardians in the area,
<--------------------->

but they're calling for
backup.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 5B1B><a 02><n 55>
I'm also detecting the
presence of a Biometal
<--------------------->

signature among the
Mavericks.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 5C1B><a 02><n 55>
Head to Area G and face
down the Maverick
threat.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 5D1B><a 23><n 2C>
Oww... The other
Guardians went further
<--------------------->

on to try and save more
people.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 5E1B><a 23><n 2C>
They were surrounded by
Mavericks and haven't
come back.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 5F1B><a 23><n 2C>
Use this old portable
transerver. Please, you
have to save everyone!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 601B><a 21><n 16>
Ah the Guardian's Mega
Man has arrived...
<--------------------->

To think their great
hero would be just a
little girl.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 611B><a 21><n 16>
But I suppose if the
Mavericks have chosen
you,
<--------------------->

then you must be the
one.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 621B><a 07><n 02>
Mavericks choosing me?
What are you talking
about!?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 631B><a 21><n 16>
The Mavericks were not
causing all of that
<--------------------->

trouble just for fun
you know.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 641B><a 21><n 16>
They were trying to
locate the perfect
vessel for Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 651B><a 21><n 16>
It is all tied into the
holders of the
Biometal.
<--------------------->

The chosen ones. The
Mega Men. You.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 661B><a 21><n 16>
After all, you survived
the Maverick raid those
many years ago.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 671B><a 07><n 02>
Are you trying to say
the Mavericks let me
live!? That can't be!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 681B><a 21><n 16>
Ah, it appears you are
not willing to accept
the truth.
<--------------------->

It does not matter,
Model W will have the
sacrifice it requires.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 691B><a 21><n 16>
The name is Fistleo, I
am the Model F
Pseudoroid.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 6A1B><a 21><n 16>
If you will not accept
your destiny, then you
<--------------------->

will have to accept
your end.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 6B1B><a 21><n 16>
Hmph. That should have
been easier. I must
continue my training.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 6C1B><a 21><n 16>
How could this happen!?
I was transformed into
a Pseudoroid...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 6D1B><a 21><n 16>
I was supposed to have
the power of a god...
<--------------------->

But I was beaten by a
little girl!
<*********************>

<p 03><d 6E1B><a 34><n 08>
Yahoo! Thanks for
saving me!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 6F1B><a 34><n 08>
I am the Biometal of
the Flame, Model F!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 701B><a 34><n 08>
Let's get a move on!
Who are we gonna take
down next?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 711B><a 05><n 02>
W-wait! I haven't even
explained anything yet!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 721B><a 34><n 08>
I know, I know, Serpent
is up to something
<--------------------->

sneaky with that
Model W.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 731B><a 34><n 08>
It's all so
complicated.
<--------------------->

I don't really know
what's going on.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 741B><a 34><n 08>
I just know that he
used my power to do his
dirty work.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 751B><a 34><n 08>
If you're out for
payback, I'm your
model!
<--------------------->

Got a problem with
that?
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 761B><a 05><n 02>
Well no...
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 771B><a 34><n 08>
Oh, the password.
<--------------------->

Sorry, but I can't give
the whole thing to you
yet.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 781B><a 34><n 08>
Serpent split my power
down the middle and the
<--------------------->

other part is with
another Pseudoroid.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 791B><a 34><n 08>
If you can take that
one down, I can give
you the password.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
You there! Are you here
to help with the rescue
operation?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Beyond that window,
one of us went inside
to help,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
but the fire has
surrounded them and now
they are trapped.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
If you stand in front
of the window and press
<--------------------->

up on the +Control Pad,
you can enter inside.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
We came to help too,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
but we got surrounded
by the flames.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
There are others who
need your help in the
area.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
Please, you have to
help them!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
Oh! By the way, make
sure you aren't
transformed when you
<--------------------->

talk to the
townspeople.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
I came here to try and
help people,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
but I can't get through
the flames.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
You could use the dash
jump to leap over them!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 29>
Please! Do whatever you
can to help the others!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
Thank you for coming to
save us!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
Just remember to
transform back to
<--------------------->

normal before talking
to people.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
Otherwise they'll be
too afraid to accept
your help.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 2A>
Of course us Guardians
know you and won't be
afraid.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
Nooo! I can't find
Bosch!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
Someone! Please save
him!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
It's so hot and
scary...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
Where are mommy and
daddy?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 40><n 3B>
I want to see mommy and
daddy! I wanna go home!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
*cough cough* Who are
you? Did you come to
save us?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
As you can see, this
room is covered in
smoke.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
Some of the people
escaped through the
room windows.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
They might still be
waiting for help on the
other side.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Did you come to help
us?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Thank you... I think
someone is controlling
the Mavericks.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
This fire is all his
fault!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
He should be at the top
of this building,
<--------------------->

getting ready to head
to the next one over.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
You've got to teach him
that if you play with
fire, you get burned!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
W-who are you? Are you
from the rescue unit?
<--------------------->

<p 02><e 01><a 48><n 43>
Help! Please!
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Thank you! I thought I
was done for!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
One of the Mavericks
that attacked this
place stood out.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
He was terrifying,
with flames covering
his body.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
He took several of the
captives away.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Be careful if you spot
him...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
He looks very
dangerous.
<*********************>

<p 02><s 01><a 48><n 43>
What!? Stop kidding
around and help me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
I don't know what else
to say but...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 48><n 43>
Thank you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
I was too slow and
couldn't escape in
time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
If you hadn't come
along, I would have
<--------------------->

become one extra crispy
old man.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
There are a lot of
others that need
rescuing.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
I sprained my ankle and
fell behind.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
I was worried I
wouldn't make it out of
<--------------------->

here alive since I
couldn't move.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
I'm so lucky you came
along when you did!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 51><n 4C>
Please, take this.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Why me!? How did I end
up in this mess?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Hey, you there! Would
you give me a hand?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
I'll make it worth your
while!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
This is nothing
compared to the value
of a life.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Please take it. It's
yours!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 56><n 52>
Yiiip! Woof woof!

me.

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
You can reach the next

top floor...

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>

controls are locked
away in there.
