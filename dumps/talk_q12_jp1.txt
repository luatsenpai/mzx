<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Oh, it's you again
Vent!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Remember the rock you
brought me earlier?
<--------------------->

Well, it's too hard for
me to break open.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I can't make what I
want if I can't get at
the material inside.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Could you take it and
smash it open using the
crusher in Area E?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I sent Oeillet, another
Guardian, to Area E.
She should be waiting
<--------------------->

there for you, so just
pass her the rock and
she'll do the rest.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Oeillet should be
waiting for you at the
crusher...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
If you give the rock to
her, she should be able
to handle the rest.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Break open the rock and
return the material to
Silure.
<*********************>

<e 01><a 02><n 55>
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Just don't damage the
power supply at the
plant.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
The conveyor belt and
crusher need power to
run properly.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
I've heard the details
from Silure.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
Leave it to me!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
With the conveyor belt
stopped, we can't crush
that rock!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
You'll have to leave
Area E and wait for the
power to come back on.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
This is it! Now I can
finally finish my
masterpiece!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I'll send it to you at
the transerver.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I'm sure you'll like
it!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Quest completed.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
300 EC and an item have
been transferred to
your account.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Did you like what I
made for you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I'll be happy just
knowing it's doing some
good.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 24><n 28>
Once you get the
material that was in
the rock,
<--------------------->

take it to Silure!
