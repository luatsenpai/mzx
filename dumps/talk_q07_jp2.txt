<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Oh where oh where has
my Mushroom gone?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I was just in the
forest and I had him in
my bag...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I keep trying to look
for him, but I just
can't find him.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
You're a transporter,
right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
If you find him, could
you bring him back for
me?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I've made the 
request, so it should
be in the transerver.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I hope my poor little
Mushroom comes back to
me safe and sound...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Find Mushroom for
Arcia.
<*********************>

<e 01><a 02><n 55>
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Hey, Mushroom is no
mushroom...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
It's the name of my pet
bird!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Please, you have to
find him!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Mushroom!!! Thank
goodness you're okay!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Mushroom only likes
girls.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I'm so grateful there
are women transporters
like you Aile!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Thank you Aile.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I was so lonely without
Mushroom these last
three hours.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Life without Mushroom
is like dinner without
dessert.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Hm? You don't get it?
I'm just trying to say
it's meaningless.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I'll send something to
the transerver in
thanks!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Oh yeah! My grandpa had
something too.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
He wanted me to give it
to you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
I'll send it to the
transerver as well.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
He used to use it back
in his ice climbing
days.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
It's a bit old, but
I'm sure it still
works like a charm.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Quest completed.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
200 EC and an item have
been transferred to
your account.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
Mushroom's acting kind
of funny.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
It must be from all the
time spent alone in the
forest.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 42><n 3D>
He reverted a bit to
him old wild self and
<--------------------->

bit me when I tried to
feed him.
