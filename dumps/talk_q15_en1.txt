<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
I've been so busy
taking care of the
injured that I
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
haven't had a free
moment to go and get
more medical supplies.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Hey! You're a
transporter. Perfect!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
I know you're busy, but
could you find medical
supplies for me?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Please bring back
anything that might be
useful.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Lives are depending on
it. I need your help.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Bring back anything
that might work as a
first aid kit.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Area L is infamous for
being a Maverick
stockpile.
<--------------------->

You might find
something there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Bring back an aid kit
from an enemy supply
container.
<*********************>

<e 01><a 02><n 55>
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
You haven't located the
medical supplies yet?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
I'll do what I can to
treat the wounded,
<--------------------->

but I'll need supplies
soon!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Thank the stars! You've
brought back aid.
This will do nicely.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
Now I can finally give
them the treatment they
require.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2D><n 21>
If I start to run low
again, I'll let you
know.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
