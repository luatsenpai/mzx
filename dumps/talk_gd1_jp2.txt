<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Are you the
transporter, <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
My name's Hareng.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
It's too early to tell
you my real name.
<--------------------->

Consider Hareng more
of a codename.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I've heard rumors...
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
About a tough little
girl using the
Livemetal to fight.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
It's all well and good
to be tough, but
sometimes you have to
<--------------------->

take a step back to see
things clearly.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
<nome>, you're alive!
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
The power of the
Livemetal is simply
amazing.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I'm glad you're safe.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
That daredevil attitude
is a good quality to
have,
<--------------------->

but don't get in over
your head!
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Girouette sacrificed
his life for you, you
need to remember that.
<--------------------->

So don't be throwing
yours away so easily.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I would never have
imagined they would
<--------------------->

launch an assault
directly on Base.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I guess we're not safe
even way up in the sky.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
If only I could have
been a chosen one...
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I would have given the
enemy a run for their
money.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I wonder how chosen
ones get chosen in the
first place.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Things aren't looking
good <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
We now know the danger
behind Model V.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Whatever we do, we must
stop their plans from
being carried out!
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
When we first met, I
had no idea you could
fight the way you do.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
I figured you were a
goner...
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Now I know better.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 26><n 1A>
Stop Serpent's blind
ambition before it's
too late!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Your name is <nome>,
right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I respect any woman as
brave as you!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I sure could use some
of your energy!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Oh, I'm sorry, I just
keep droning on.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I'm a mechanic.
The name's Anguille!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I may not look like
much, but I've got some
skill with machines.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I work for Silure and
I help him out all
the time.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I may need to ask you
for help someday <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Thanks in advance for
any help you can
provide!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
You're alive <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I'm so happy! I never
thought I would see you
again!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I can't imagine what we
would do if anything
happened to you...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I know you want to
avenge your mother,
<--------------------->

but that doesn't mean
you should take
unnecessary risks.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
<nome>, you must live on
and continue where
Girouette left off...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I know how you must
feel, but try to be
strong...
<--------------------->

I know he's watching
over you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Are you okay <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I'm surprised they
decided to directly
assault Guardian Base.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
We're lucky you came
back when you did.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
I don't even want to
think about what would
<--------------------->

have happened to us
otherwise...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
In the beginning,
everyone was saved by
Serpent...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Now in the end, they
are all to be
sacrificed.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
It's like we're nothing
more than playthings to
him.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
He's nothing more than
a bully preying on the
innocent!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
Don't let Serpent Co.
dig up the Model V
Core!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
The world will never
survive if they get
their hands on it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 30><n 24>
You're the only one
that can put a stop to
Serpent <nome>!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Thanks for before.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I knew you would pass
the test.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
My name is Carrelet.
Yours was <nome>,
wasn't it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
If there's anything I
can do to help, just
ask!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I wonder if Anguille is
ever going to finish my
chip...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I gave him everything
he needed to work on it
half a year ago.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
He doesn't seem to care
very much about being
timely with things...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You're alive!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I know the Livemetal
helped, but you did the
rest.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Humans are capable of
things that can't be
explained by science.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
They're incredible.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Oh yeah.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You can take on
missions and quests
from any transerver.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
It's probably more
convenient to take on a
request near the
<--------------------->

location of the
mission.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
How are you doing?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You did great
protecting this ship.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You passed the test,
and then you saved us
all.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
But there will be more
tests on the road
ahead.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
It seems as if several
Falseroids are
<--------------------->

standing guard in the
Outlands.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You already know that
the areas are divided
into several blocks.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
But you won't be able
to tell if a Falseroid
<--------------------->

is in the block or not
until you enter it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Any Falseroids that
have regenerated can be
<--------------------->

seen from the map
though.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
If the block is
blinking red,
<--------------------->

then you know they have
regenerated.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You've come a long way.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I never would have
guessed you could make
<--------------------->

it this far fighting
alone.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
I have something to
tell you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
Anguille finally
finished the chip I
requested.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
It's called an Eraser
Chip, and it allows you
<--------------------->

to destroy enemy shots
with your saber.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 25><n 19>
You could put it to
better use than I ever
could. Please take it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Yikes! You scared me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Don't surprise me
like that.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
You should knock
before entering a
room.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Hey, aren't you the
girl that was going
through the test?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Sorry, I never properly
introduced myself. My
name is Congre.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I really have no idea
why I'm working here...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
Oh! It's you... You
shouldn't sneak up on a
guy like that...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
How are you holding up?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
It was a million to one
shot you could survive
an attack like that.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I respect your
courage...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
But you should try to
stay out of harm's way.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
*phew* I was so
scared...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
This is the first time
the enemy has ever been
<--------------------->

bold enough to attack
Base.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
We're so high up in the
air, we never expected
an attack.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I'm holing up in my
room for awhile.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I'm not sure if it's
safe to go out yet or
not.
<--------------------->

They might come back...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I knew you had it in
you,
<--------------------->

but I never imagined
you were that good.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I wish I had even just
1% of your courage...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2B><n 1F>
I know there's nothing
I can do for you,
<--------------------->

but I'll still keep on
rooting for you!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
What's your name ma'am?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Ooh, <nome>. That's a
pretty name.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
My name's Sardine.
Prairie gave me that
name.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
It's cool isn't it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I tried to name
Prairie's stuffed
animal for her.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
But she didn't like the
name I came up with.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
It was a good name
too... She's no fun.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Are you okay <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I don't want you to get
hurt! Please be
careful.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
If you get hurt, we
won't be able to play
anymore...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I can't lose another
friend...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Will you be my friend
forever and ever <nome>?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I've never seen the
enemy attack us like
that before.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
But I wasn't scared!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I knew you would come
and save us <nome>!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
With you around, I can
be brave too!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
I want to protect
everyone when
I grow up!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Get Serpent for me,
okay <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
You're our only hope!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
If peace is back,
Silure might be able to
make me another toy!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
This toy is called
Little Moby.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Silure's made me other
toys, but...
<--------------------->

*whisper* They weren't
that fun...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
One toy looked like an
oven with legs...
<--------------------->

It was too weird to
play with.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 28><n 1C>
Don't tell Old Silure
though, he'll just get
sad.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Why hello there. Aren't
you <nome> from Girouette
Express?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
My name is Silure.
Pleased to meet you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I can't believe the
little girl in front of
<--------------------->

me is able to change
into Model X!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I don't know exactly
how you were chosen...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
But I do know that
sending such a young
girl into danger shows
<--------------------->

how desperate these
times are.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I love wiling away the
hours fiddling with
machines...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
But there's not much
space for fixin',
<--------------------->

so I sometimes borrow
Fleuve's lab.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
He seems to be working
on something important
in there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Bless my soul, you're
alive <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I was so worried about
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
By the way...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I heard that Serpent
Co. has begun work on
<--------------------->

using Livemetal to
design Repliroids.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Fleuve told me about
them and was calling
them Falseroids.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I'm guessing that all
of the incidents that
keep popping up in the
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Outlands have something
to do with the
Falseroid experiments.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Falseroid Livemetal is
very fragile.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
That means that Serpent
Co.'s technology for
working with Livemetal
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
is still far from
perfect.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Some Serpent Co.
Repliroids and
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Mechaniroids have the
ability to regenerate.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
That might be one power
inherent in the Model V
fragment.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
It sends a shiver down
these old bones just
thinking about it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
Ah, you're okay.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I wasn't sure how much
longer this old ship
would last.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
I'm glad I finished
reinforcing her
yesterday...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
But she won't hold
together through
another battle.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
The deck area has taken
the worst of it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
And I just don't have
time to fix it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
We'll just have to keep
running her as-is and
hope for the best.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
We've come a long way.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
The final battle lies
ahead <nome>.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2F><n 23>
This old man is in your
corner!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Wow, I didn't know
there was a cute girl
like you around here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Ah, I know you! You're
that girl with
Girouette Express...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Earl? Or something like
that...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Wait... <nome>! How could
I forget a lovely
young lady's name?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
That's a travesty for
one as suave as
myself.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Don't get too upset.
Aile, Earl, close
enough eh?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I was so stunned by
your beauty that I
forgot the intro.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I'm the coolest guy in
these parts. The name's
Scombrésoce.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I'm always here, so
come by anytime.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Everyone else is a dud
anyway. Don't even
bother talking to them.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
See ya around!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Hey, are you okay?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Don't put your neck on
the line just because
you have the Livemetal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
It's your body that
gets hurt, not the
Livemetal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Better know your limits
before you go and get
yourself wasted.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Hey <nome>, I've got
something to tell you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
There's an area in the
Outlands that gives off
powerful signals.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
They mess with your
senses so that left and
right are backwards and
<--------------------->

sometimes you can't
even fire your weapon.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Not to worry though. If
you have some smelling
salts,
<--------------------->

you'll stay clear in
the head.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I'll sell you some for
10 EC.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Who'd have thought
they'd have the nerve
to attack Base?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I was all set to show
them my mad fighting
skills too.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
But I was locked in.
Too bad eh?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I wouldn't let them
harm a hair on your
head.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
So stick with me <nome>!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
You're more than just a
cute girl.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
You've really got some
fight! I'd hate to
make you mad.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I value my life too
much to do something
that dangerous.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
It looks like the rest
is up to you <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
We won't be able to do
anything for you in
the coming battle.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
What is it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><e 01><a 29><n 1D>
Need smelling salts?  
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Better safe than sorry
eh?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
Just remember that it
won't work if you use
<--------------------->

them while getting hit
with the signal that
scrambles your senses.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
I'd love to give you
more, but I only had
the one pack on me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
They're only 10 EC, but
you still have to pay.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 29><n 1D>
No? Well, I guess I
can't force them on
you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
Thank you for your help
<nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
My name's Sole.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
My clothes still smell
like smoke.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
It's a shame we had to
meet under such
circumstances.
<--------------------->

You only get one
chance at a good first
impression...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
I was surprised by
everything that
happened.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
I really wish it was
all just a bad dream.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
It's a good thing the
Base warehouse was
reinforced.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
Normally things are
kept as thin and light
<--------------------->

as possible to make
flying easier.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
I know I'm not the one
that has to fight
Serpent.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
But I'm still so
nervous.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
Whatever you do <nome>,
make sure Serpent is
stopped!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 30>
You're the only one who
can do it!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
Hey! I'm glad to see
you passed the test.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
My name's Dorado.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
There are more and
more Irregulars
in the Outlands lately.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
The situation has
gotten to the point
<--------------------->

where we can't protect
people anymore.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
Now that you're here...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I hope that we can do
something about them.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I can't believe it...
Are you okay now?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
How you can still be
standing after taking a
hit like that,
<--------------------->

I have no idea.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
It must be the power of
the Livemetal.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I went to town
yesterday for the first
time in ages,
<--------------------->

but it was too big and
I just got lost.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I'm so stubborn, I
didn't check my map.
<--------------------->

Don't make the same
mistake.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
Press START to open the
sub-menu then choose
Mission.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
You can see the
connection with other
<--------------------->

areas and your current
location.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
You weren't hurt, were
you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
The ship was shaking so
much, I fell right on
my butt.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I'm still not in great
shape, but I can't just
sit around.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
Did you find out what's
behind Model V?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
There are so many
rumors flying around
lately,
<--------------------->

I don't know what's
real and what isn't.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
No one but you can
stand up to Serpent
Co.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2E>
I'm sorry that I can't
be more helpful to
you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Oh! First time I've
seen you around here,
little girl.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Where did you come
from? I hope you have
permission to be here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Are you the girl that
saved Prairie and the
others in the forest?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
That WAS you?!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Wow! Oh, my name's
Truite!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
You did an amazing job
back there. Could I see
the Livemetal?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
No?! Aww, come on! Show
it to me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
If it was me, I'd put
it in a display case so
it didn't get dirty.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
You're a transporter,
aren't you <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I might need your help
someday.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Actually...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Hmm... never mind. I
won't bother you with
it now.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Oh, I didn't know you
were talking to me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
How's your body holding
up?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
No Livemetal can
help if you get
mortally wounded.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Hm? You still need to
talk to me about
something?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I'm a little busy at
the moment.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
That was a big
earthquake just now,
wasn't it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Huh? It wasn't an
earthquake?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Base is a flying
airship you say?!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I didn't even notice we
were under attack.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Goes to show how
oblivious I am.
<--------------------->

I'm glad everyone else
is on top of things.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Are you looking for
Model V?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Here I thought you were
just working the
<--------------------->

Guardian Base branch
for the transporters.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I didn't know you were
entrusted with such a
heavy burden.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I just figured you were
the chosen one of the
day for Model X.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Hey there little miss!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I was worried about ya,
but it looks like ya
passed our test!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
What's your name?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Oh! <nome> is a nice
name. My name's Thon!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Grahaha! Ya say it
suits a big guy like
me?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Hey little miss, are
ya okay?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I can't believe they'd
attack a little girl
not even half my size!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
That Serpent Co.! They
have no shame.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
It always feels like
the world is okay when
you're up in the sky.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
But every time ya look
down from the clouds,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
ya see the world the
Irregulars are makin'.
<--------------------->

By takin' on Serpent
Co.,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
we're effectively
takin' on the whole
country.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
We better give it
everythin' we've got,
or we're toast.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I never woulda figured
we had a chance.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I was expectin' them to
punch a big hole right
through the ship!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Prairie was amazin'.
Nothin' ever shakes her
resolve...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Her courage is
awe-inspiring.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I don't care if they're
the biggest company in
the land.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
You make sure you pay
them back for all the
damage they caused us!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
They need to learn
we're not to be
messed with!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Good luck <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I still can't hardly
believe it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
A little girl with the
courage of a thousand
people rolled into one.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
You're really somethin'
<nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
Your little shoulders
are bearin' a bigger
burden than any of us
<--------------------->

can even imagine.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
But you've carried it
this far. There's
nothin' to worry about.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
You've still got a long
life ahead of ya.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2C><n 20>
I believe in ya! You
should believe in
yourself too!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Hey <nome>! My name's
Bar.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Thanks for saving me
earlier.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Muguet already patched
up the injury that the
<--------------------->

snake Mechaniroid gave
me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Muguet's a real pro,
but she nags a bit too
much for my taste.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Rose is gentle and shy,
so she's more my type.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Maquereau hurt his leg
in the battle. I wonder
how he's doing.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I have some advice for
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Try not to transform
around town.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Irregulars wandering in
from the Outlands,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
or security
Mechaniroids will sense
the weapon you hold,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
and attack on sight.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
People around town will
be nervous around you
because of the danger.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
There might come a time
when you'll have no
choice, but be careful.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
<nome>, you had us all
worried sick.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I know how you feel
about not wanting to
stand around.
<--------------------->

But try to take it
easy.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Oh yeah.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I found something out
about the Repliroids
known as Falseroids.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
They possess the
ability to regenerate
themselves.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
If left alone, they'll
come back to life
automatically.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
It looks like that's
one of the things
Serpent Co. was
<--------------------->

researching behind the
scenes.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
People don't know any
better and treat
<--------------------->

Serpent like some
national hero.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Oh, did you already
know all of that?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Are you okay <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
The Guardians were okay
thanks to the room
security systems.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
We got hit pretty hard.
<--------------------->

Thank the lucky stars
no one was seriously
injured.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Well, actually we
should be thanking you
for that.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
So you've found the six
Livemetal fragments
now?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Now all that's left is
for you to harness the
power of the Livemetal.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
Oh yeah!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I found this chip when
I was patrolling the
forest earlier.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
With it, your body
won't sink or break
<--------------------->

through fragile
surfaces.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2B>
I don't go to the
Outlands, so I won't be
needing it.
<--------------------->

You should take it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Yes <nome>, what is it?
<*********************>

<p 02><m><a 22><n 18>
  Check Database
  Talk
  Nothing
<*********************>

<p 02><m><a 22><n 18>
  Repair Livemetal
  Check Database
  Talk
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
There are a lot of us
Guardians around the
ship.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
If you have time,
perhaps you should say
hello to everyone.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
The Guardians can be
strange sometimes, but
they're good people.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Try not to get angry
and just hear them out.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
<nome>! Are you alright?!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I know you want to get
back into action,
<--------------------->

but you need to learn
to control the
Livemetal.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Take it easy and master
the power of the
Livemetal.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I'm shocked.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I would never have
expected us to show up
on the enemy's radar.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
We must change our
flight plans to avoid
detection again.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I'll contact the
Operators and let them
chart us a new course.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I've got something
interesting to tell you
<nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Did you know that each
Livemetal fragment has
been divided into two
<--------------------->

pieces and split
across two different
Falseroids?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
If you can find both
parts,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
you will have access to
two varieties of charge
<--------------------->

attacks for each
model.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
The usage differs
according to the model.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
For Models HX, LX and
PX, you charge up to a
second level and then
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
press +Control Pad up
while releasing the
attack button to fire.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
For Model FX, charge it
up to the second level
and then press
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
+Control Pad down while
releasing the attack
button to fire.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
At last! You've
collected the six
Livemetal fragments.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Our future is now in
your hands <nome>.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
You're the only one
with the power to save
us...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
We have faith in you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Oh yes, <nome>...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Please take this with
you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
This chip will cut your
weapon's charging time
down.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
It used to belong to
another Guardian,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
and it took time to
synchronize it with
your Livemetal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I just finished it a
little while ago.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
You'll need to file
your mission report
<--------------------->

before I can repair
your Livemetal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
Please file it at the
transerver and then
come back then.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
<nome>! I have excellent
news!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
About the strange stone
you found in Area N-1,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
I think I may have
figured something out.
Could I have a look?
<*********************>


Handed over <c 03>Mysterious Rock
<*********************>

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
All done! This turns
out to be a special
variety of Livemetal!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 22><n 18>
It has a very funny
glow to it, but you
<--------------------->

should be able to use
it to transform.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I feel so pathetic.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I tried to rescue
everyone from the fire,
<--------------------->

but ended up needing
rescuing myself.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I'm glad you came along
when you did.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Thank you so much for
your help.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I shudder to imagine
what would've happened
<--------------------->

if you didn't arrive
when you did.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
We were in a big pinch.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Your moves were
incredible as you wiped
<--------------------->

enemy after enemy off
of our ship.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Serpent Co. grows more
powerful with each
passing second.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
We have to find the
rest of the Livemetal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
If we don't, this world
is as good as
Serpent's.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
Thanks to you, it feels
like the Guardians
stand a chance.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
I hope we aren't
holding you back. It
feels like there's not
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2F>
much we can do for you
now.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Hi <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
That lava was pretty
scary, wasn't it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Did you happen to find
the switch for
controlling its flow?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
I'm so embarrassed that
I keep needing your
help.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
I should've been the
one to rescue all those
people from the fire,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
but you had to do it
instead.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
When the room was
filled with smoke, I
thought I was a goner,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
but then I saw your
smiling face. You're
like my guardian angel.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
I was worried about you
<nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
The ship was rocking so
much, I thought a
meteor hit us.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
You didn't get hurt,
did you <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
I'm still wounded, so
I've been resting here.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Are those the six
Livemetal fragments
you've got there?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
They're amazing.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
Incredible technology
must be behind the
Livemetal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2C>
It's hard to believe it
was made centuries
ago...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
Dudette! You're <nome>,
aren't you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
I'm Morue, and it's so
cool to meet you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
Did you get a chance to
meet everyone in Base?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
They're all good
people, you should
totally chat it up.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
It looks like that road
in Area D-1 is still
outta commission.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
At least it does the
trick for keeping out
Irregulars on foot.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
The switch in front
activates with a quick
attack.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
You might be able to
continue down the
road now.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
You had me worried
<nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
I thought you got
wasted. I was so
totally about to mourn.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
It's awesome that
you're okay!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
You might already know
this,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
but you can only take
on one mission or quest
at a time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
If you want to ditch
one for another,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
you have to cancel the
current one.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
That means everything
you've done so far is
for nothing though,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
so you'll have to start
from scratch when you
try it again.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
I almost wet my pants
when I saw all those
ships surrounding us.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
You're one brave
dudette <nome>!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
Those are the six
Livemetal fragments?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
It's like they're
totally all harmonizing
with each other.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
Just don't let those
Serpent Co. dudes get
a hold of Model V.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 23><n 2D>
This world is so gonna
be wasted if they get a
hold of it!
