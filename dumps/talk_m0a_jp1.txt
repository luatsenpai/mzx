<p 02><d 1127><a 02><n 55>
We received a report
about the Guardian
recon unit
<--------------------->

data disk intercepted
by the enemy.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1227><a 02><n 55>
The word is that the
Serpent Co. unit that
has it is on the move.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1327><a 02><n 55>
The enemy is
transporting it using a
<--------------------->

tunnel deep under the
sea in Area J.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1427><a 02><n 55>
Head to Area J and
recover the data disk.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 1527><a 02><n 04>
The data disk contains
the report that Sis was
<--------------------->

working on while she
was in the recon unit.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1627><a 05><n 01>
So it contains the rest
of what we decoded from
<--------------------->

the other disk we found
at the distress call
source...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1727><a 02><n 04>
We found the enemy
delivery unit along
<--------------------->

with a Livemetal
signature.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1827><a 02><n 04>
There must be something
important stored on
that disk.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1927><a 02><n 04>
The Livemetal signature
is further back in the
same area.
<--------------------->

Be careful Vent.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 1A27><a 1E><n 13>
Hwahaha! So you're the
great Rockman that
keeps trying to
<--------------------->

interfere with our
plans.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1B27><a 1E><n 13>
I suppose it's asking
too much to expect
someone so young
<--------------------->

to understand what
we're trying to do.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1C27><a 1E><n 13>
You should respect your
elders and listen to us
old folk.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1D27><a 05><n 01>
I don't usually listen
to shady types like you
<--------------------->

that go around and hide
the truth.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 1E27><a 05><n 01>
So don't expect any
respect from me.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 1F27><a 1E><n 13>
Hwahaha! Sometimes
ignorance is bliss
little one!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2027><a 1E><n 13>
I am the Model L
Falseroid, Leganchor.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2127><a 1E><n 13>
It looks like I'll have
to teach you some
respect.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 2227><a 1E><n 13>
Now that's a good
little boy.
<--------------------->

Sleep tight at the
bottom of the sea.
<*********************>

<p 03><d 2327><a 1E><n 13>
Why... Why do you fight
so hard?
<--------------------->

Why do you risk your
life for those fools?
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2427><a 1E><n 13>
Youth is wasted... on
the young...
<*********************>

<p 03><d 2527><a 35><n 09>
How could anyone give
my power to someone
like that?!
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2627><a 35><n 09>
I'm sorry, it'll take
some time to recover
the password.
<--------------------->

<p 03><d 2727><a 35><n 09>
I'll make sure it's
available before
<--------------------->

you have to take on
Model V.
<*********************>

<p 02><d 2827><a 02><n 04>
Vent, the data disk,
is...
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2927><a 05><n 01>
Yeah, the recon unit
report is on it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 04><n 00>
The recon unit was
wiped out by the act of
one of our own.
<*********************>

<p 01><p 02><a 04><n 00>
His name is Serpent and
he was always the one
<--------------------->

most interested in the
Model V fragment.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 04><n 00>
He erased the research
data and vanished with
the Livemetal.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 04><n 00>
I've never heard of an
Irregular that
powerful.
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 04><n 00>
Model V must have
transformed him into
"something else."
<--------------------->

<p 01><p 02><a 04><n 00>
We now know that
Model V has the power
to create an enemy much
<--------------------->

more terrifying than
the Irregulars.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 04><n 00>
I only hope that our
sacrifice bought the
<--------------------->

commander enough time
to escape.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 04><n 00>
I don't have much
longer. I pray that
this data
<--------------------->

doesn't fall into the
wrong hands.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2A27><a 02><n 04>
Serpent was awfully
worried about that data
leaking out.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2B27><a 02><n 04>
He must have known the
reaction the people of
<--------------------->

this country would have
if they knew the truth.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2C27><a 02><n 04>
Send the data disk
along with your mission
report.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2D27><a 02><n 04>
We can't allow the
information contained
on it to get out until
<--------------------->

we know exactly what
it is.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2E27><a 05><n 01>
Alright, I'll send it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 2F27><a 02><n 04>
Sis... She must have
gotten away while the
others protected her.
<--------------------->

<p 02><d 3027><a 05><n 01>
