<*********************>


Eyeballoon
<*********************>


This Mechaniroid was
developed to prevent wild
Outland birds from eating
the crops. As this need
faded, they were equipped
with ring beam weapons to
drive away other enemies.
<*********************>


Frostybear
<*********************>


This polar bear Mechaniroid
has portable cooling units
on its arms allowing it to
create snowballs for hurling
at enemies. While its arm
temperature can drop below
zero, it manages to stay
warm internally.
<*********************>


Angle Cannon
<*********************>


This Mechaniroid's tough
armor can repel any attack.
Its powerful attack can
also blast through any
armor. However, every
Achilles has a heel...
<*********************>


Web Bolt
<*********************>


This spider Mechaniroid
lives in the wiring. Over
time, it has evolved the
ability to fire electric
bolts to trap prey. With an
infrared sensor in its
stomach, it can operate just
as effectively in the dark.
<*********************>


Rattrap
<*********************>


These Mechaniroid mice tend
to come in huge numbers.
With so many of them, they
are sometimes prone to
short-circuit and blow up.
<*********************>


Energy Cannon
<*********************>


This cannon has a protective
hatch which will open up
just long enough for it to
fire an energy blast. Given
time, it learns how to more
efficiently utilize energy
for more powerful attacks.
<*********************>


Shrimpstroke
<*********************>


This shrimp Mechaniroid
propels backwards through
the water. It uses its
antennae to feel out enemies
and will fire a shot when in

directions. The propellers
are sharp blades that will
cut anything that comes in
contact with them into
pieces.
<*********************>


Capsule Shooter
<*********************>


This cannon fires capsules
that bounce off of floors
and walls. Once the capsule
settles down, it blows apart
and shots come out.
Cutting-edge prize machine
technology is used to
prevent capsule jamming.
<*********************>


Galleon Wing
<*********************>


This Galleon has a flight
unit attached to its back.
It can fly freely through
the air while using its
buster weapon to attack. Its
frame is much lighter than a
normal Galleon to aid in
flight.
<*********************>


Galleon Shroud
<*********************>


This Galleon uses a bunker
for protection. It opens a
hatch to fire its bazooka
and fires its buster weapon
from a gap in the bunker. If
the Galleon inside is
destroyed, the bunker is
taken down with it.
<*********************>


Galleon Diver
<*********************>


This Galleon rides an aqua
cycle and receives

allowing it to dive deep
beneath the surface. If the
pipe ruptures, the Galleon
will succumb to water
pressure and be destroyed.
<*********************>


Galleon Burner
<*********************>

This floating security
Mechaniroid can fire shots
up & down or left & right.
If it is on the receiving
end of a powerful blast,
it'll get sent flying.
<*********************>


Crickaleap
<*********************>


This wild Mechaniroid hops
around erratically. A long
time ago, an outbreak of the
hoppers resulted in hundreds
of casualties and they have
been much feared ever since.
<*********************>


Sci-sensor
<*********************>


These assembly kit
Mechaniroids were donated to
schools all over by Serpent
Co. They don't require glue
or tools to put together and
are quick to be thrown away
when something else catches
the child's fancy.
<*********************>


Spi-King
<*********************>

30 recycled tires smashed
together and fitted with 8
dangerous spikes. The spikes
give it the ability to roll
anywhere regardless of the
surface condition.
<*********************>


Springer
<*********************>


This security Mechaniroid
uses its powerful springs to
constantly leap about. It
has a special stabilization
system that prevents it from
falling over.
<*********************>


Chain Anchor
<*********************>


The spike at the end of this
Mechaniroid's chain attaches
itself to a surface and
sends a powerful electrical
current coursing into the
target. It's possible to
grab onto the chain or use
it as a footing.
<*********************>


Beanball
<*********************>


The principles of leverage
are employed with this rock
throwing Mechaniroid. If it
manages to build up enough
energy, the flaming rocks it
hurls are enough to punch
through walls and cause an
explosion on impact.
<*********************>


Sphenalauncher
<*********************>


This iguana Mechaniroid
fires the spikes on its back
like missiles. It is
normally quite docile, but
if a perceived threat
approaches, it will react
aggressively.
<*********************>

Innerpeace. Its roots are so
deep that it's rumored all
of them are connected to a
single source.
<*********************>


Bee Rockets
<*********************>


These bee Mechaniroids are
very territorial. They tend
to travel in groups and are
willing to sacrifice
themselves for other
members. On occasion, they
will use their combined heat
to trigger an explosion.
<*********************>


Whirling 38
<*********************>


It sprays out fire while
spinning around at high
speeds. Its rotational
ability comes from an
internal drive device. If it
gets hit with too powerful a
shock, it will fly off the
rope. Exercise caution.
<*********************>


Whirling 44
<*********************>


This Mechaniroid continues
to move up and down on a
metal rope. Its original
design is based on a toy
that the designer's child
used to play with. It was
created to be art, but has
become a dangerous weapon.
<*********************>


Fire Dart
<*********************>


This hermit crab Mechaniroid
can use its powerful suction
feet to move upside down on
surfaces. With a little
tinkering, these hot
machines can be
reverse-engineered to become
a convenient cooking range.
<*********************>


Buoybuoy
<*********************>


This sea turtle Mechaniroid
uses its fins to stay
afloat. It protects itself
from enemies by laying down
bombs while swimming around.
<*********************>


Shock Face
<*********************>

These Mechaniroids tend to
operate in groups of three
and will vary their
formations to try and
confuse the enemy while they
swoop in for an attack.
<*********************>


Batty
<*********************>


These bat Mechaniroids tend
to appear out of nowhere and
focus their attacks on
weakened enemies. There's an
urban legend that says the
locations they congregate at
are cursed.
<*********************>


Presto Cannon
<*********************>


This cannon has been weighed
down with modifications to
increase its firing and cool
down rates. The main flaw in
this design is that it is so
heavy it can't move.
<*********************>


Hover Cannon
<*********************>


This cannon has two firing
ports. If an enemy
approaches, it attempts to
use its hovering ability to
run away, but it quickly
runs out of power. It fires
a special shot that breaks
into three smaller shots.
<*********************>


Bora Bora
<*********************>


This fish Mechaniroid eats
microbes, converting them to
energy, and this helps clean
the water making it quite
environmentally friendly.
However, it is not so
friendly to enemies that
enter its territory.
<*********************>


Marine General
<*********************>


This sea anemone Mechaniroid
was designed from the
beginning as a weapon. It
was meant to provide an
obstacle for enemies in the
water and is based on a
biological organism that has
long gone extinct.
<*********************>

were the result of research
into ancient technology. The
experiments conducted failed
and resulted in these
troublemakers. They will act
aggressively towards
perceived threats.
<*********************>


Rayfly
