Its├NEWLINE┤frame is much lighter than a├NEWLINE┤normal Galleon to aid in├NEWLINE┤flight.├END┤Galleon Shroud├END┤This Galleon uses a bunker├NEWLINE┤for protection. It opens a├NEWLINE┤hatch to fire its bazooka├NEWLINE┤and fires its buster weapon├NEWLINE┤from a gap in the bunker. If├NEWLINE┤the Galleon inside is├NEWLINE┤destroyed, the bunker is├NEWLINE┤taken down with it.├END┤Galleon Diver├END┤This Galleon rides an aqua├NEWLINE┤cycle and receives├NEWLINE┤compressed air from a pipe,├NEWLINE┤allowing it to dive deep├NEWLINE┤beneath the surface. If the├NEWLINE┤pipe ruptures, the Galleon├NEWLINE┤will succumb to water├NEWLINE┤pressure and be destroyed.├END┤Galleon Burner├END┤This Galleon has a jet├NEWLINE┤burner on each shoulder.├NEWLINE┤When the fuel runs out, it├NEWLINE┤will drop down and wait to├NEWLINE┤recharge.

A long├NEWLINE┤time ago, an outbreak of the├NEWLINE┤hoppers resulted in hundreds├NEWLINE┤of casualties and they have├NEWLINE┤been much feared ever since.├END┤Sci-sensor├END┤These assembly kit├NEWLINE┤Mechaniloids were donated to├NEWLINE┤schools all over by Slither├NEWLINE┤Inc. They don't require glue├NEWLINE┤or tools to put together and├NEWLINE┤are quick to be thrown away├NEWLINE┤when something else catches├NEWLINE┤the child's fancy.├END┤Spi-King├END┤This weapon is comprised of├NEWLINE┤30 recycled tires smashed├NEWLINE┤together and fitted with 8├NEWLINE┤dangerous spikes. The spikes├NEWLINE┤give it the ability to roll├NEWLINE┤anywhere regardless of the├NEWLINE┤surface condition.├END┤Springer├END┤This security Mechaniloid├NEWLINE┤uses its powerful springs to├NEWLINE┤constantly leap about. It├NEWLINE┤has a special stabilization├NEWLINE┤system that prevents it from├NEWLINE┤falling over.├END┤Chain Anchor├END┤The spike at the end of this├NEWLINE┤Mechaniloid's chain attaches├NEWLINE┤itself to a surface and├NEWLINE┤sends a powerful electrical├NEWLINE┤current coursing into the├NEWLINE┤target. It's possible to├NEWLINE┤grab onto the chain or use├NEWLINE┤it as a footing.├END┤Beanball├END┤The principles of leverage├NEWLINE┤are employed with this rock├NEWLINE┤throwing Mechaniloid. If it├NEWLINE┤manages to build up enough├NEWLINE┤energy, the flaming rocks it├NEWLINE┤hurls are enough to punch├NEWLINE┤through walls and cause an├NEWLINE┤explosion on impact.├END┤Sphenalauncher├END┤This iguana Mechaniloid├NEWLINE┤fires the spikes on its back├NEWLINE┤like missiles. It is├NEWLINE┤normally quite docile, but├NEWLINE┤if a perceived threat├NEWLINE┤approaches, it will react├NEWLINE┤aggressively.├END┤Tornado Fencer├END┤This drill-shaped├NEWLINE┤Mechaniloid is constantly├NEWLINE┤rotating at high speeds.

Its roots are so├NEWLINE┤deep that it's rumored all├NEWLINE┤of them are connected to a├NEWLINE┤single source.├END┤Bee Rockets├END┤These bee Mechaniloids are├NEWLINE┤very territorial. They tend├NEWLINE┤to travel in groups and are├NEWLINE┤willing to sacrifice├NEWLINE┤themselves for other├NEWLINE┤members. On occasion, they├NEWLINE┤will use their combined heat├NEWLINE┤to trigger an explosion.├END┤Whirling 38├END┤It sprays out fire while├NEWLINE┤spinning around at high├NEWLINE┤speeds. Its rotational├NEWLINE┤ability comes from an├NEWLINE┤internal drive device. If it├NEWLINE┤gets hit with too powerful a├NEWLINE┤shock, it will fly off the├NEWLINE┤rope. Exercise caution.├END┤Whirling 44├END┤This Mechaniloid continues├NEWLINE┤to move up and down on a├NEWLINE┤metal rope. Its original├NEWLINE┤design is based on a toy├NEWLINE┤that the designer's child├NEWLINE┤used to play with. It was├NEWLINE┤created to be art, but has├NEWLINE┤become a dangerous weapon.├END┤Fire Dart├END┤This hermit crab Mechaniloid├NEWLINE┤can use its powerful suction├NEWLINE┤feet to move upside down on├NEWLINE┤surfaces.

Many engineers were├NEWLINE┤lost in the design phase.├END┤Frozen Face├END┤This model of Mechaniloid is├NEWLINE┤the third in a series based├NEWLINE┤on giant face sculptures. It├NEWLINE┤fires frozen junk from its├NEWLINE┤mouth at enemies and will├NEWLINE┤make sad noises when no one├NEWLINE┤is near.├END┤Fly Chopper├END┤These Mechaniloids tend to├NEWLINE┤operate in groups of three├NEWLINE┤and will vary their├NEWLINE┤formations to try and├NEWLINE┤confuse the enemy while they├NEWLINE┤swoop in for an attack.├END┤Batty├END┤These bat Mechaniloids tend├NEWLINE┤to appear out of nowhere and├NEWLINE┤focus their attacks on├NEWLINE┤weakened enemies. There's an├NEWLINE┤urban legend that says the├NEWLINE┤locations they congregate at├NEWLINE┤are cursed.├END┤Presto Cannon├END┤This cannon has been weighed├NEWLINE┤down with modifications to├NEWLINE┤increase its firing and cool├NEWLINE┤down rates. The main flaw in├NEWLINE┤this design is that it is so├NEWLINE┤heavy it can't move.├END┤Hover Cannon├END┤This cannon has two firing├NEWLINE┤ports. If an enemy├NEWLINE┤approaches, it attempts to├NEWLINE┤use its hovering ability to├NEWLINE┤run away, but it quickly├NEWLINE┤runs out of power. It fires├NEWLINE┤a special shot that breaks├NEWLINE┤into three smaller shots.├END┤Bora Bora├END┤This fish Mechaniloid eats├NEWLINE┤microbes, converting them to├NEWLINE┤energy, and this helps clean├NEWLINE┤the water making it quite├NEWLINE┤environmentally friendly.├NEWLINE┤However, it is not so├NEWLINE┤friendly to enemies that├NEWLINE┤enter its territory.├END┤Marine General├END┤This sea anemone Mechaniloid├NEWLINE┤was designed from the├NEWLINE┤beginning as a weapon.
