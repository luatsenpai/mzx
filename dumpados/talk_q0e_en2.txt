<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Hey there transporter.
I have a favor to ask
of you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Could you deliver a
letter to you-know-who
in Guardian HQ for me?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
I'll send the letter to
the transerver.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Deliver the letter to
Truite in Guardian HQ.
<*********************>

<e 01><a 02><n 55>
  Yes
  No
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
A letter for me? I
wonder who it could be
from?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
Oh, it's from her! What
could she be writing
me about...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
"The man I passed in
the street that day is
<--------------------->

not the kind of man
that gets discouraged."
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
"I don't like the fact
that you're stubborn
and overly optimistic."
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
"But I don't like you
being negative even
more."
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I wonder if that means
she likes me or hates
me...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
That's the first time
I've ever written a
letter.
<--------------------->

I hope it helped him
feel better.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
I have to admit, I was
really annoyed by all
of his silly letters.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
But now that I know I
won't be getting
anymore,
<--------------------->

I'm kind of sad.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Well, I just hope my
letter cheered him up.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
You don't think it was
too much, do you?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
I was just happy to get
a reply for the first
time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
But it's only a matter
of time before I pass
<--------------------->

out of her thoughts
entirely...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
Quest completed.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 02><n 55>
100 EC have been
transferred to your
account.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
Thank you...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4B><n 46>
If I ever have another
letter, I know who to
call!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 2A><n 1E>
To make sure I always
remember her,
<--------------------->

I've recorded my 
memories of her onto a
special chip.
