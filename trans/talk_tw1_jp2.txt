<p 02><a 37><n 32>
Thanks miss!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
I got a little too
close to the fire,
but I'll be okay.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
You rescued me just in
the nick of time!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
I'm scared to go
outside, so I'm staying
here.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
Why didn't Serpent Co.
come and save us?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
That building is
theirs, isn't it?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
Their own employees
were trapped inside
with me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
Mommy used to say
that Serpent Co. saved
this country...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
But I don't believe
that anymore.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
I went outside for the
first time yesterday!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
But when I reached the
highway, I got really
scared.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
I can't just hide
inside forever.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
When I see people like
you staring danger
straight in the face...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
I want to be strong
too!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
Is that getup popular
nowadays?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 37><n 32>
You look scary just
like a Serpent Co.
guard.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Are you the little lady
that saved me from the
fire?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
I thought so...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
These old bones are
still around thanks to
your help.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Thank you.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Did you manage to save
the others?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
It'd be such a waste if
only this old codger
made it out...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
I used to go out to the
hot springs in Area K
with my family...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Now it's too hot to go
in without burning
myself.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
I wonder what kind of
treasure might be
<--------------------->

hidden in the lava
fields?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Those Serpent Co. folk
seem to be awfully
interested in the area.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
You know, I got to
thinking...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Even though the fire
took place in a Serpent
Co. building,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
there's not one peep,
let alone an apology
coming out of them.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
I hate to talk bad
about them,
<--------------------->

but they've
got my knickers in a
bunch!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Fiddlesticks,
I shouldn't have said
anything bad
<--------------------->

about Serpent Co.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Forget I said it...
I know I will.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Jumping jehosaphat!
What are you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4D><n 48>
Get outta here! Go on
skedaddle!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
I know you. You're the
girl I met playing hide
and seek!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
When are ya gonna come
back and play with us?!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
I wonder if there's
some trick to hide and
seek...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
I guess if I was too
good,
<--------------------->

people would stop
looking for me and
that'd be no fun.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
I wonder what I should
play today...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
I can't play hide and
seek without any
seekers.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
I'll just have to go to
Morgan's shop in Area
C-2 and play there.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
Hmm, I only have enough
money for one game...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
Mom always said I
should play outside
near mountains and
<--------------------->

forests on nice days.
"Experience nature,"
she says.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
But there are no safe
places to play anymore.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
That's why I just hang
around town all the
time now.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
When it's safe again, I
wanna explore a cave or
climb a mountain.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
For now, I have to wait
until the Irregulars
are gone.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
Hm?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3B><n 36>
Haven't I seen you
before? Maybe it's just
my imagination.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
You're the young girl
that saved me, aren't
you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
I'm sorry for the harsh
words earlier.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Four out of five
buildings in the area
belong to my company.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
All of the maintenance
is left to computers,
<--------------------->

so there aren't many
people around.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Most of the employees
are Repliroids.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Humans are too easily
distracted by their
emotions.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
I can understand why
the president doesn't
want to hire them.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
This country wouldn't
be the great place it
<--------------------->

is today without
Serpent Co.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
I'm proud to be an
employee of the best
company on the planet!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
We could use someone
like you. You should
join us!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
The competition to get
in is fierce though.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Maybe it's better to
give up any dreams of
being elite like me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Something seems to be
on the president's mind
lately.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
He keeps digging around
in the Outlands like a
man possessed.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
I wonder when it all
started.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
Seems to be around the
time those two showed
up...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
I'm sure the president
has just got a lot on
his mind.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
I know he has our best
interests at heart!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
What's with that
outfit?!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
If you look like that,
the security guards are
going to go after you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 51>
You better change
clothes if you don't
want trouble.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Hey miss! Good to see
you again!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Let's play hide and
seek somewhere safer
next time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
I'll make sure you'll
never be able to find
me!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Nothing beats the
thrill of hearing the
seeker's footsteps
<--------------------->

closing in on you when
you're hiding.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
The cave in Area A-4
is the best!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
It feels just like I'm
in an action adventure
movie!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Have you ever been to
the other side of the
cave in Area A-4?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
I heard there's an
entrance from the sea
in Area J.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
but I was too scared by
the dark to go there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Mom and dad don't want
me going to places like
the forest or caves.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
They think it's
dangerous, but I crave
danger.
<--------------------->

Danger is my best
friend. Danger is...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Another busy day for
you?
<--------------------->

I'm watching the place
while everyone's out.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
It's so boring here
with mom and dad gone
all the time.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
I'm tired of just
playing by myself all
the time.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
It's always funner with
friends.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Cool armor! Where can I
buy a suit like that?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
Oh, hey!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
I have a chip that
would be just perfect
for your armor!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
It's called a Frog
Chip. Here, check it
out!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
It'll give you grip
when sliding down
walls.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3A><n 35>
No one here uses it, so
you can have it.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Aren't you the girl
that saved us earlier?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
I thought bravery was
dead, but you've
restored my faith.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Thanks to you, I'm
alive and my life's
back to normal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
I'm taking strolls in
the forest, fishing at
the lake...
<--------------------->

Ah, it's bliss.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
I want to see so much
of the world.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
If only the snowy
mountains weren't in
the Outlands,
<--------------------->

I'd whip out the old
ice boots and go
climbing.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Why were you wearing
those snazzy duds when
you saved us?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Ah... I get it!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
You're part of the
rescue squad from
Serpent Co.!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
It must be some fancy
new suit they developed
<--------------------->

and you were testing it
out.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Where can I buy a
costume like the one
you were wearing?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
With that, I could
climb the tallest
<--------------------->

mountain and swim in
the deepest sea!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
I think there's a lot
of undiscovered country
waiting for me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
I want to explore as
many ruins and distant
lands as possible while
<--------------------->

these legs can still
walk.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Adventure is the heart
and soul of a man.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
That's something that
never changes no matter
how old a man gets.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
I used to have nerves
of steel when it came
to facing danger.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
No matter how old I
am, I always want to
laugh in its face!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Hey you! Can I have a
moment?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
That sparkly doo-dad of
yours...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Is it a Pink Crystal?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
How did you get that?!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
I'll trade you this
Ice Boots Chip for it!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
I won't take no for an
answer!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Woah! You scared me!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4E><n 49>
Incredible! I wish I
had a great costume
like that!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
Hey lady, you want
something with me?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
I was captured by some
bad guys and was being
held in a dark room.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
But then someone came
along and saved me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
I couldn't see who it
was though because the
room was so dark.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
No one ever cleans the
rooftop on this
building.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
Weeds keep popping up
there all the time.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
Are you the one that
saved me from the dark
room before?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
Nah... It can't be you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
Ah, it doesn't matter
anyway.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
It was scary being
trapped in such a small
place for so long.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
But I'm a boy, so of
course I never cried.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
The girl that was with
me never stopped crying
though...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
My grandpa keeps saying
the same things over
and over again.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
He keeps telling me how
"this country was
without power and in
<--------------------->

terrible shape a long
time ago."
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
"Compared to that,
this country is a
paradise now."
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
He loves to
exaggerate...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
"With our cushy
lifestyles, we take
<--------------------->

everything for granted
nowadays..."
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
That's what grandpa
says anyway.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
Hm? Who are you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 38><n 33>
Are you an...
Irregular?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
<nome>!!!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
The name's Halison. You
saved me from the
burning building.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
I may not look it, but
I'm a cameraman.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Innerpeace is too...
<--------------------->

Well, peaceful. I
thought it was my
chance for a big break.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
My plan was to take a
few days off, but no
rest for the wicked.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Rain or shine, I have
to go and earn a
living.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
I'm going to keep
scanning the city for
any hot scoops.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
I snapped a photo of
the Irregular who saved
us, but the subject was
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
too fast and all I 
ended up with was a
blur.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Oh well, it's not like
I could have gone
public with it...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
If I even hinted at
Serpent Co.'s
negligence,
<--------------------->

I'd be snaked off
somewhere and
disappear.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Nothing ever happens in
this town...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Oh yeah, <nome>!
<--------------------->

Would you mind being a
model for me?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
No, huh?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
I can understand...
<--------------------->

You do look pretty
busy, being a
Dịch Chuyểner and all.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Hey <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Another day, and no
scoops...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Guess I better expect
the usual 20% pay cut
this month.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
I need to find a
company that doesn't
<--------------------->

care about making money
and work there.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
I've been working the
beat and gathering the
facts.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
I think that Serpent
Co...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
May not be as good a
company as people give
them credit for.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
O-oh! An Irregular in
Innerpeace?!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 45><n 40>
Now this is a scoop!
Camera, camera, where's
my camera?!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Hey lady! How ya doin?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Me? Not so well, my
dad's mad at me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
He found out I was
hanging out in the
<--------------------->

Outlands and playing
around.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
I'll bet Jeff's mom
squealed on me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
I'm never playing with
that guy again.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Hide-and-seek is a
blast. We're lovin' it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Well, after eight days
straight, it did get a
little stale.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Maybe the first three
days were fun...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
All good things should
be taken in moderation.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
I heard somethin'
interestin' from my
grandpa.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
This used to be just a

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
I heard somethin'
interestin' from my
dad.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Serpent Co. saved this
country from an energy
crisis.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
They must be geniuses
to find a way to create
all that energy!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
If I study hard enough,
maybe I can be a big
shot like the president
<--------------------->

of Serpent Co.
someday!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Huh? What's with the
sad face?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Somethin' about the
word "president" sounds
cool.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
"President Frank" has a
nice ring to it, don't
ya think?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Wow! You're cool!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
Oh... I'm sorry...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3C><n 37>
My dad told me not to
talk to strangers.

Oh! Hey, aren't you the
seeker from our hide

<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
You seeking again, or
are you hiding this
time?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
Oh, you were just
looking for us because
of Jeff's mom, right?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
Man, she's such a worry
wart.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>

This building looks
weird doesn't it?

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
You can't even get in
without ducking down.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
It's like they messed
up when building it.

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
Some Dịch Chuyểner...

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
My mom told me not to
go too far, so I'm
stuck here.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
Irregulars are even at
the amusement park...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
All of the good play
spots are getting taken
away.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
I remember having a ton
of fun at the amusement
park when I went there.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3D><n 38>
Now even the
attractions themselves
have become Irregulars.

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
Who are you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
Oh... A Dịch Chuyểner
with Girouette Express
you say?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
I've heard the name
before, but I'm not too
familiar with it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
According to the
rumors, they take on a
lot of dangerous work.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
I'm warning you. Don't
do anything suspicious
<--------------------->

in Serpent Co.
territory.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
There's a lot going on
that I don't know
about...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
But that's to be
expected with a big
company.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
The president seems to
go on a lot of business
trips lately.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
I'm not sure what he's
doing, but he better
take it easy.
<--------------------->

Balance work and
private life, you know?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
What?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
You don't know where
Serpent Co. is
located?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
It's the giant building
facing the highway in
Area D-2.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
It might be a massive
building,
<--------------------->

but it's still such a
small part of Serpent
Co.'s total assets.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
I met the president the
other day.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
He seems to be a lot
bigger than the first
time I saw him.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
It must just be the
psychological effect of
<--------------------->

his magnificent
presence...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
Lately the president
has been busy
<--------------------->

investigating around
Area M.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
I'm just glad I don't
have to go to a
<--------------------->

dangerous place like
that.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
I don't envy the
dangerous work you're
doing...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
But I can respect a
young person like
yourself working hard.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
Oh! I've got something
for you.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
It's an orange from my
wife's hometown.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
Hey you! The suspicious
character in the
strange getup!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 55><n 50>
Don't move! I'm calling
for backup, then we're
taking you in.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
My my, who are you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
My name's Morgan and I
run this joint.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
I watch over it to make
sure kids have a safe
place to play games.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
Some of the games
have conditions to meet
before you can play.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
The ones available will
have their screens
lit up.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
Stand in front and
press up on the
+Control Pad.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
The other door to the
transerver in the next
<--------------------->

room outside leads out
to the highway.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
The highway is
crawling with
Irregulars,
<--------------------->

so you'd best watch
yourself if you go
out there.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
They've split the
road to make sure
people don't
<--------------------->

accidentally wander
into danger.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
By the way, the
transerver in the next
<--------------------->

room is just for
communications.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
To teleport, you have
to find one of the tube
shaped transervers
<--------------------->

designed specifically
for that purpose.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
The boy?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
My dream is for him to
one day work for
Serpent Co.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
Then he could take care
of his old man.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
You're a real hard
worker. I'm impressed!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
I wish my boy could be
more like you...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
You wanna play
anything?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
You look pretty busy,
so maybe next time eh?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
Hey <nome>, have you
played Crusher-F yet?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
In that one, you punch
balls to knock them
into enemies.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
The machine used to be
busted, but I fixed it
up!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
My my, what are you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 50><n 4B>
You look like you
jumped straight out of
<--------------------->

one of these here video
games.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
Hey there! I'll tell
you something.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
There's an arcade in
Area C-2.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
I'd love to play some
games, but I don't have
enough E-Crystals.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
If you ever have spare
ones, you should check
it out.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
It feels just like
you're in the game!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
Hey again! How do you
like my wheels?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
I know it's just a toy,
but it's so realistic!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
My dad bought one for
me and one for my
little brother.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
Mine's called Red
Striker!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
His is the Rush
Roadster!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
The real ones used to
rule the tracks back in
the olden days.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
This is just a toy, so
it doesn't go as fast
as the real thing...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
The break's grip is
good,
<--------------------->

but the accelerator
just isn't as
responsive as I'd like.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
I can put the pedal to
the medal, but I still
only hit 5 mph.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
When I grow up, I want
a fast car that I can
cruise around town in!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
It would be great to
hit the gas and go
<--------------------->

riding off into the
sunset!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
I want to be a racer
someday.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
Don't tell Lou though,
he'll just copy me...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
I'll take home a mega
huge trophy,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
and use all the prize
money to buy my mom and
dad a nice house!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3E><n 39>
My teacher said not to
talk to strangers...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I know how mom feels...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I don't want to upset
her or anything.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I'm trying to decide 
my own path in life,
you know.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
But mom just won't stop
trying to force her
dreams on me.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
My future should be
mine, not hers right?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
Why does everyone think
Serpent Co. is so
great?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
Simple. They take care
of their employees and
have a bright future.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I just want to do a job
that makes me happy.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I probably should study
harder to make sure
that I can do that.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
Mom always says I
should study more every
time I see her.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
She's obsessed with me
entering Serpent Co.
and being some suit.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
I talked to mom about
how I feel.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 39><n 34>
She seemed to
understand where I was
coming from...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 39><n 34>

Hey miss, are you one
of those Dịch Chuyểner
people?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
I thought you were
supposed to have a bike
or a car for the job.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
Huh? Some bad guys
destroyed it?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
That's too bad...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
Hop in the passenger
seat, I can take you
where you want to go!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
I'm going to race my
brother someday!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
But something is wrong
with his car, so it
moves super slow.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
I'll win anytime,
anywhere with my car!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
I want to tune my car
so I can race my
brother.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
I'm no good with fixing
things, so I want dad
to help...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
But he's no good with
this stuff either.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
After he got a hold of
the steering wheel,
<--------------------->

the car won't turn
right anymore...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
Dad said he used to be
a mechanic!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
But me and my brother
don't believe him.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
Why does he say such
crazy things?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
*sigh* That's our
dad for you...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
I want to be a racer

<--------------------->

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
Don't tell Yu though!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 3F><n 3A>
Yu complains about
everything I do.
<--------------------->

He always thinks he's
number one.

Thanks for saving me

building.

If it weren't for you,
I'd be charcoal.

You won't be able to

Security has been

It's a big hassle, but

The lava fields are

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
The lava keeps rising
and has everyone
worried.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
It could overflow and
reach town at any
moment.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
There used to be a spa
resort town around the
area,
<--------------------->

but that's gone
now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
It's hard to relax in a

<--------------------->

are dangerous
Irregulars roaming
around.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
I can't sleep with the
constant sounds of
digging at night.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
What on earth could
they be digging for?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
A long time ago, war
destroyed city and
nature alike...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
But thanks to Serpent
Co., this town is the
<--------------------->

magnificent place you
see today.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
I sometimes hear
whisperings that
<--------------------->

Serpent Co. is up to
no good...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
But if the rumors were
true,
<--------------------->

it would mean the end
of the world as we know
it.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 44><n 3F>
I wouldn't worry
yourself. They're just
rumors after all.

That car over there has
been parked for ages.
It's blockin' the way.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
It's probably outta
energy. I wish
it would get moved.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
It must be nice to have
a car.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
I'd love to go on a
drive in the mountains
with my girlfriend,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
but I don't have a car,
so we'd have to walk
there...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
My girlfriend is a
really quiet person.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
It's kinda mysterious
and alluring.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
We don't need words to

<--------------------->

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
You'll understand
someday.

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
Serpent Co. deserves
our gratitude...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
Even if the peace ended
and we went to war...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
I know me and my
girlfriend would still
<--------------------->

find our happy place in
the world.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4C><n 47>
...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4C><n 47>
Oh stop... You're
embarrassing me.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
H-hold on! Who are
ya?!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 47><n 42>
I'm calling the guards!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
Thanks <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
For what? Don't tell me
you forgot...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
I was one of the people
you rescued from the
dark room.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
I was just a hair's
width away from
becoming a Cyber-elf.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
I work at a warehouse
managing inventory.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
Actually, I've worked
with you at Girouette
Express in the past.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
<nome>, you don't know
anyone at Serpent Co.
do you?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
All of my friends keep
hassling me to get a
real job.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
They always say the
future is bright with
Serpent Co.!
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
I'm proud of the work I
do now.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
No one ever believes me
though...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
My friends say that
Serpent Co. has a
huuuge warehouse...
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
Filled to the brim with
all sorts of fancy,
cutting-edge weaponry.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
But that's ridiculous.
<--------------------->

Why would Serpent Co.
be stockpiling
weaponry?
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
What?!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
You're saying that
Serpent Co. was behind
our kidnapping
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
and the attempt to turn
us into Cyber-elves?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
That's a pretty lame
joke <nome>.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
It's probably the doing
of some slimy company
that wants to ruin
<--------------------->

Serpent Co.'s good
name.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
Oh yeah, <nome>!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
I wanted to thank you
for what you did for
me. Take this.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
This Absorber Chip will
help you avoid getting
<--------------------->

knocked back by enemy
attacks.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
I used it back when I
worked a part-time job
in the Outlands.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
It still works like a
charm.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
Woah! What's with the
getup?!
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
Is that you <nome>?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 46><n 41>
You better be careful
running around looking
like that.
<--------------------->

Other people might
freak out.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
You look like the sort
of person that keeps
things tidy.
<--------------------->

My boy is a little
rascal, 
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
and he never seems to
want to clean up his
room.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
Hey, do you like
soccer?
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
When I saw you running,
I thought I sensed a
fellow soccer buff.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
I heard there's a game
over in Area C-2 where
<--------------------->

you dribble a ball to
the goal.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
You might want to check
it out if you have some
spare E-Crystals.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
If I was just 10 years
younger, I'd be there
playing that game too.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
It requires more
coordination than this
<--------------------->

tired body can pull
together.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
I tried to kick the
ball around yesterday,
<--------------------->

but I fell flat on my
face.
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
I better work harder to
stay in shape...
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
I may never return
to my glory days,
<--------------------->

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
but I would like to run
around the old field
and shoot a few goals.
<*********************>

<p 02><a 4F><n 4A>
Aaah! W-who are you?!
